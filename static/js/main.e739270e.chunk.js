Acedemically, I have used Java, C, C#, Python, Haskell, mySQL, and PHP (to my chagrin). For the majority of my own projects, I have been using the Node.js framework with JavaScript.

Most conlangs (particularly the most fleshed-out) are inspired by ascpects found in languages spoken around the world. It's abosolutely facinating how many different ways humans have combined syntax and semantics to convey meaning. I am particularly interested in grammatology \u2013 the study of writing systems and scripts. Of the languages I have looked into, I am especially intrigued by abugidas \u2013 a script that contains consonant characters with consistant vowel modifiers (Hindi and Sanskrit are two examples).

I enjoy playing tennis on a very casual scale and have played baseball and soccer in the past, but ballroom has been an area of my life that I've placed more time. I tend to be very opposed to coreographgy (as it feels very unnatural to me), and I prefer social dancing above performance. I was a devoted member of the ballroom dance club when I was in college, and I still enjoy going to dance socials when I have the time. Recently, my skills have deteriorated (due to not having consistant teaching and practice), but I still enjoy the hobby and participate whenever given the oppportunity. I am particularly a fan of dances in the swing family (East Coast and to some the Hustle), but I have experience in some rhythmic dances like Salsa and Samba and smother dances like the Waltz as well.
