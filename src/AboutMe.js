      <header>Basic Description</header>
      <p>
        I have recently graduated from Covenant College in Lookout Mountain, Ga,
        and I have a BA in Computer Science &ndash; Software Development concentration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am passionate about programming,
        and I enjoy learning new programming languages, libraries, and paradigms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the languages I have worked with,
        my favorite is definitely JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acedemically, I have used Java, C, C#, Python, Haskell, mySQL, and PHP (to my chagrin).
      </p>
      <p>
        For the majority of my own projects,
        I have been using the Node.js framework with JavaScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the last few months,
        I have been teaching myself Functional Programming and Test-Driven Development.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently, I am teaching myself React &ndash; this site is a react app.

      <header>Other Interests</header>
      <p>
        Outside of programming, my interests include cooking, con-langs, and ballroom dance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would not consider myself an expert in any of these areas,
        but I feel as though each of these hobbies improves other aspects of my life.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy experimenting as I cook.
      </p>
      <p>
        I typically don't memorize a recipe and perform its steps repeatedly each cooking session.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy digging into the how and why of each ingredient and procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning why salt should go into cookies, what baking soda does to a recipe,
        and how to keep a steak from drying out as it grills are all subskills to expand my cooking repertoire.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cooking, when approached the right way, can be incredibly modular.
      </p>
      <p>
        The things I have learned from making one dish can improve the next recipe I make.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though conlanging may forcibly place me in a certain stereotype,
        I persue it and am not ashamed by my hobby.
      </p>
      <p>
        Canlang is short for constructed-language.
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been quite a few conlangs made over the years,
        but some of the most famous ones are <code>Klingon</code> an <code>Elvish</code> (note: Elvish is techically an entire group of conlangs, and "Elvish" is not its official name).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't personally learn these other languages,
        but I do study them by trying to understand their construction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most conlangs (particularly the most fleshed-out) are inspired by ascpects found in languages spoken around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's abosolutely facinating how many different ways humans have combined syntax and semantics to convey meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly interested in grammatology &ndash; the study of writing systems and scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the languages I have looked into, I am especially intrigued by abugidas &ndash;
        a script that contains consonant characters with consistant vowel modifiers (Hindi and Sanskrit are two examples).
      </p>
      <p>
        During my persuit of creating my own script, I have taught myself Hiragana, Katakana (two syllabaries used in Japanese),
        and some Cyrillic (the alphabet used in many slovic languages).
      </p>
      <p>
        Not having the phisique for many typical American sports, I have not gotten too invested in most of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy playing tennis on a very casual scale and have played baseball and soccer in the past,
        but ballroom has been an area of my life that I've placed more time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tend to be very opposed to coreographgy (as it feels very unnatural to me),
        and I prefer social dancing above performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was a devoted member of the ballroom dance club when I was in college,
        and I still enjoy going to dance socials when I have the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, my skills have deteriorated (due to not having consistant teaching and practice),
        but I still enjoy the hobby and participate whenever given the oppportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am particularly a fan of dances in the swing family (East Coast and to some the Hustle),
        but I have experience in some rhythmic dances like Salsa and Samba and smother dances like the Waltz as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of the dances I have participated, I would say that the only one I do not enjoy as much is the Tango.
